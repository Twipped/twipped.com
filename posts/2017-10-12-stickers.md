title: Sticker Tribes
---

I decided today to remove several of the stickers off my laptop. As I was cleaning the sticky goo off the lid my wife comes over and asks why I took them off. I explained how they were all logos of JS libraries that had strong competitive elements, and I put them on there to advertise my allegiances.

```http
Her: So, what, those aren't popular any more?
Me: Sorta, it's more that I don't feel comfortable displaying that kind of tribalism any more. It's just so... male.
```

She nods her head.

```http
Me: It's too much the kind of thing Jarvis would do.
She grins and says...
Her: Hey, I married Jarvis, quit talking crap about my ex.
```
